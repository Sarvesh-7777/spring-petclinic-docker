# Spring Petclinic Docker

## Objective
The goal of this project was to set up the Spring Petclinic application using Docker and push the project to a GitHub repository.

## Tools Used
- **Visual Studio Code**: For editing the code and managing the project files.
- **Docker**: To create a containerized version of the Spring Petclinic application.
- **Git**: For version control and pushing the project to GitHub.
- **GitHub**: To host the project repository.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Installed Necessary Tools
- Installed Visual Studio Code, Docker Desktop, and the Java Extension Pack.

### 2. Set Up the Project
- Created a folder for the Spring Petclinic project.
- Downloaded or cloned the Spring Petclinic source code.

### 3. Created a Dockerfile
- Developed a `Dockerfile` to define the environment for the Spring Boot application using OpenJDK 17. The `Dockerfile` includes:
  ```dockerfile
  # Use an official Java runtime as a parent image
  FROM openjdk:17-jdk

  # Set the working directory inside the container to /app
  WORKDIR /app

  # Copy the application JAR file from your local machine to the container
  COPY target/spring-petclinic-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /app/petclinic.jar

  # Expose ports 8080 and 8081
  EXPOSE 8080 8081

  # Command to run the Spring Petclinic app when the container starts
  ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/petclinic.jar"]
  ```

### 4. Built the Application
- Used Maven to build the Spring Petclinic application, generating the JAR file.

### 5. Built the Docker Image
- Built the Docker image using the Dockerfile with the command:
  ```bash
  docker build -t my-petclinic-image .
  ```

### 6. Pushed to Docker Hub (if applicable)
- Tagged the image and pushed it to Docker Hub to make it accessible for deployment.

### 7. Initialized a Git Repository
- Initialized a Git repository in the project folder and added the remote GitHub repository:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/Sarvesh-7777/spring-petclinic-docker.git
  ```

### 8. Added Files to Git
- Added all files to the Git staging area and committed them:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit with Dockerfile and Spring Petclinic setup"
  ```

### 9. Pushed to GitHub
- Pushed the committed changes to the GitHub repository:
  ```bash
  git push -u origin main
  ```

## Outcome
Successfully created a containerized version of the Spring Petclinic application and uploaded all project files, including the Dockerfile, to the specified GitHub repository.

## Challenges Faced
- Encountered issues with the default Java version and had to switch to OpenJDK 17.
- Resolved remote repository errors and ensured all files were pushed correctly.

## Conclusion
The task was completed successfully, and the project is now available in the GitHub repository, ready for further development or deployment.
